# Releasing

Maintainer guide for publishing a new version of `@piwikpro/vue-piwik-pro` to npm.

## Prerequisites

- You have merge rights to `master` and your working tree is clean.
- CI on `master` is green.
- Publishing to npm is automated: it runs from `.github/workflows/main.yml`
  when a **GitHub Release** is published, using the `NPM_TOKEN` secret. You do
  not run `npm publish` by hand.

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org):

- **patch** (`x.y.Z`) — bug fixes, dependency bumps, no public API change.
- **minor** (`x.Y.0`) — new backwards-compatible functionality.
- **major** (`X.0.0`) — breaking changes.

## The changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com)
convention and is generated from git history by
[auto-changelog](https://github.com/cookpete/auto-changelog) — Each entry comes
from a merged pull request, so the quality of
the changelog depends on clear PR titles.

The changelog lists **released versions only** — there is no persistent
"Unreleased" section, since it would go stale between releases. The entry for a
new version is produced automatically as part of the release (see below). To
preview what will be in the next release at any time, use the GitHub compare
view (`<last-tag>...HEAD`), or run `npx auto-changelog --unreleased --stdout`.
(`npm run changelog` only regenerates the released history — it does not show
pending changes.)

## Release steps

Releases go through a pull request, like everything else — do **not** push the
version bump or a tag directly to `master`. The tag is created by the GitHub
Release **after** the PR is merged, so it points at the real squash-merge commit
on `master`.

1. Start a release branch from an up-to-date `master`:

   ```sh
   git checkout master && git pull
   git checkout -b release/x.y.z
   ```

2. Bump the version. This does **not** create a commit or tag — `.npmrc` sets
   `git-tag-version=false`, so `npm version` only edits `package.json`. The
   `version` npm lifecycle hook still runs, so this also regenerates the
   changelog (adds the new version heading + commits since the last release) and
   bakes the version into the build:

   ```sh
   npm version <patch|minor|major>
   ```

3. Commit and push the branch:

   ```sh
   git commit -am "release x.y.z"
   git push -u origin release/x.y.z
   ```

4. Open a **`release x.y.z`** pull request and squash-merge it into `master`.
   This is what lands the changelog and version bump on `master`.

5. On GitHub, create a **Release** with a **new tag** `x.y.z` targeting `master`.
   GitHub creates the tag on the merged commit. Use the matching `CHANGELOG.md`
   section as the release notes.

6. Publishing the GitHub Release triggers `main.yml`, which builds and publishes
   to npm. Verify at

## Notes

- When you create the GitHub Release, type the tag **unprefixed** (`1.7.1`, not
  `v1.7.1`). This matches the existing tag history and the changelog compare
  links, which auto-changelog derives from the (unprefixed) `package.json`
  version. The tag is created by the GitHub Release, so this is a manual
  convention — nothing enforces it automatically.
- If a release fails to publish, fix the issue and re-publish the GitHub
  Release (or re-run the `main.yml` workflow); you do not need a new version
  for a failed publish.
